# 3D-fMRI-region-mapping
Shows the basic pipeline for perfoming 3D region mapping for time sequenced fMRI data using jupyter notebook. Using nilean probabalistic region mapping to find the regions of interest for time sequence fMRI data, we integrate volumetric rendering to get the volumes of these specific regions over time.

Basic pipeline for integrating nilearn region mapping with 3D-fMRI rendering:
